Snowplow Normalize 0.3.0 (2023-03-28)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version migrates our models away from the `snowplow_incremental_materialization` and instead move to using the built-in `incremental` with an optimization applied on top. 

## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
### Changes to materialization
To take advantage of the optimization we apply to the `incremental` materialization, users will need to add the following to their `dbt_project.yml` : 
```yaml
# dbt_project.yml
...
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt
    search_order: ['snowplow_utils', 'dbt']
```

For custom models please refer to the [snowplow utils migration guide](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/migration-guides/utils/#upgrading-to-0140) and the latest docs on [creating custom incremental models](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-custom-models/#incremental-models).

## Features
- Migrate from `get_cluster_by` and `get_partition_by` to `get_value_by_target_type`
- Migrate all models to use new materialization

## Docs
- Update readme

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-normalize version in your `packages.yml` file, and ensuring you have followed the above steps. You can read more in our [upgrade guide](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/migration-guides/normalize/#upgrading-to-0140)

- Add ability to alias `user_id` column
- Add ability to add flat columns to the events table

## Under the hood

Snowplow Normalize 0.2.0 (2022-12-19)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This release drops support for dbt versions <1.3 to use the latest dbt-utils package, adds functionality for custom user_ids and multiple events per table, as well as ensuring all appropriate versions of BigQuery contexts are used. Due to these changes this version contains a number of breaking changes, so please read the Upgrade section carefully.

## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
- Config file structure has changed to enable multiple event types per table
- Macro inputs have changed to enable multiple event types per table and custom user_id field
- The filtered events table has a new column to enable multiple event types per table
- Support for versions of dbt < 1.3 has been dropped

## Features
- Allow for multiple event types (including self-describing) per normalized table
- Allow for custom user_id field within users table
- BigQuery optimized to use all same major version number sdes and contexts (in line with other Snowplow packages)
- Enhanced testing and warnings under the hood
- Drop support for dbt versions below 1.3 (Close #17)

## Upgrading
To upgrade the package, bump the version number in the packages.yml file in your project.

### Upgrading your config file
To upgrade your config file:
- Change the `event_name` field to `event_names` and make the value a list
- Change the `self_describing_event_schema` field to `self_describing_event_schemas` and make the value a list
- If you wish to make use of the new features, see the example config or the docs for more information

### Upgrading your models
Once you have upgraded your config file, the easiest way to ensure your models match the new macros is to re-run the Python script. If you would prefer not to do thi, you can:
- For each normalized model:
  - Convert the `event_name` and `sde_cols` fields to lists, and pluralize the names in both the set and the macro call
  - Add a new field, `sde_aliases` which is an empty list, add this between `sde_types` and `context_cols` in the macro call
- For your filtered events table:
  - Change the `unique_key` in the config section to `unique_id`
  - Add a line between the `event_table_name` and `from` lines for each select statement; `, event_id||'-'||'<that_event_table_name>' as unique_id`, with the event table name for that select block.
- For your users table:
  - Add 3 new values to the start of the macro call, `'user_id','',''`, before the `user_cols` argument. 

### Upgrade your filtered events table
If you use the master filtered events table, you will need to add a new column for the latest version to work. If you have not processed much data yet it may be easier to simply re-run the package from scratch using `dbt run --full-refresh --vars 'snowplow__allow_refresh: true'`, alternatively run the following in your warehouse, replacing the schema/dataset/warehouse and table name for your table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE {schema}.{table} ADD COLUMN unique_id STRING;
UPDATE {schema}.{table} SET unique_id = event_id||'-'||event_table_name WHERE 1 = 1;
```
